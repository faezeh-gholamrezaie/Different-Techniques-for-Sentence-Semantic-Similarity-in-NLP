# Different-Techniques-for-Sentence-Semantic-Similarity-in-NLP
Here, various techniques for text embedding are provided to address the problem of predicting the topic of a set of abstracts from two different branches, "Machine Learning in Statistics" and "Applied Statistics," along with their corresponding category labels. Your task is to train a simple classifier that can predict the topic of an article based on its abstract input.
