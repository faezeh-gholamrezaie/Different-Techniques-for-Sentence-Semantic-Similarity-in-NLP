# Vectorization-Techniques-tutorial
Here, various techniques for text embedding are provided to address the problem of predicting the topic of a set of abstracts from two different branches, "Machine Learning in Statistics" and "Applied Statistics," along with their corresponding category labels. Your task is to train a simple classifier that can predict the topic of an article based on its abstract input.

This repository provides a tutorial for those interested in learning about vectorization methods in Natural Language Processing (NLP) using PyTorch and TensorFlow. The majority of the models in this tutorial are implemented with less than 100 lines of code (excluding comments or blank lines).

This code provides a solution to the "Which Statistic?" question in the LLM Hackathon Qualifier.
